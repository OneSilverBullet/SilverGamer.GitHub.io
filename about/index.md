## About My Name
This name comes from the Silver Expeditionary Army by Warcraft. Warcraft had a profound influence on me, which threw me into game development. Without the support of my parents, teachers, and society, I have been sticking to the road of game development for seven years. Though the game industry is criticized in China, I still firmly believe that game development is the intention I possess pursued all my life. I hope I have the same courage as the Silver Expeditionary Army, no matter the ending, as a silver player until the end of life.

* 2018 - 2021  Master Degree, Tianjin University.
* 2014 - 2018  Bachelor Degree, Northeast University.
